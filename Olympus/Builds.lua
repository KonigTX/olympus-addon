-- 1.5.4, modified builds (the owner's call, 2026-11-08: "se a versão for modificada ele trava, a
-- comunicação com ela"). A build of Olympus changed by a third party is handed around (made from
-- 1.5.1; its version string is no release form, "1.5.1-<suffix>"): it never checks for newer
-- versions, answers no version check, keeps its own terms, and its users count in the army like
-- anyone else. What this client can see of such a build it marks, records, shares among the guild
-- masters, the officers and the High Council, and locks out; what it shows says "modified build",
-- plainly, and names no third party. A careful fork can lie about all of it; this bites what is
-- observable today.
--   * Detection. A peer's announced version (its hello over GUILD, Comm.lua's H1; its answer to a
--     version check, Versions.lua's V8) that is no release form marks a modified build: a release
--     is x.y.z or x.y.z.w, and the author's own arena test builds say x.y.z-test.N (never modified;
--     their hello says the base version anyway). Anything else ("1.5.1-onn.12", "1.5.3-custom", an
--     empty or non-numeric version where the field is there) is modified.
--   * A weaker mark, "silent to version checks" (shown, never a lock): a guildmate whose hello names
--     a release that answers version checks (1.1.2 and newer), and who answered none of SILENT_ASKS
--     checks of this client spread over SILENT_SPAN at least, with a hello of his heard between each
--     check and the next. The hello is the proof his client was sending addon messages in each
--     interval: in a dungeon, a raid or a match the game holds every addon message (the hello too,
--     Comm's queue), so a client that could not answer sends no hello either, and one check can
--     never do it. Quiet presence sends no hello (no mark); an idle 1.5.3 client answers every check
--     by itself within seconds (Versions.HandlePing). What is left: a client that blocks or ignores
--     the asker answers nothing and keeps saying hello, so the mark is only ever a hint to look.
--   * Records. ns.db.builds (account-wide): MAX sightings at most, the oldest out; each the character,
--     the version string, how (the hello, an answer, the silent mark), first and last seen, who
--     reported it (this client, or a guild master's, an officer's or a councillor's shared word).
--   * Sharing. A guild master or officer of an Olympus guild, a High Councillor, the King or the
--     author tells the others of a sighting of his own: one word (BD) over GUILD and on the channel
--     (so it travels by the relay), once an hour per sighting, SHARE_PER_MIN a minute at most. Taken
--     only from a sender the roster (over GUILD) or the census (Data.AuthorizedRank, on the channel)
--     makes a guild master or an officer, or a councillor, the King or the author; kept with the
--     reporter's name; never a lock. A plain member's client sends none and keeps none.
--   * The lock. A client this one saw announce a modified build (the strong mark alone: never a
--     shared word but on a relay's client, below; never the silent mark, never our own client) is
--     locked out at Comm's door:
--     nothing it says reaches a handler, the census or a relay here, but its hello and its version
--     answer, which clear the mark when they name a release (the sighting stays in the record). A
--     relay takes no registration from it and drops one it holds (Relay.lua); the arena's words
--     from it are refused (ArenaNet.lua). Its lines in the Olympus chat go the way of /oly block's:
--     dropped at the same door. What it sees of us is unchanged (the owner's call: nothing hidden
--     from them, nothing but the code).
--   * The relays (the owner's call, the same day). A relay's client (Relay.IsRelay(ns.me)) keeps the
--     reporters' records as a guild master does, and acts on a listed character as on one it saw
--     itself: no registration taken, one held dropped, nothing forwarded, its RL words dropped. The
--     records cross between the relays as the guild verifications do (RW, Relay.lua): a word a
--     relay hears from its clients goes once to every other relay, which hands it to its reporters;
--     a word from a relay or the author is trusted as a guild master's. Our own observation beats
--     the list: a listed character that says a release to us directly is cleared here, and that
--     clearing is shared (a "c" word) so the other keepers' lists clear too; a keeper's clear never
--     lifts a mark this client made itself.
--   * The author's ask (the owner's call, the same day). Every PROMPT_EVERY the author's relay client
--     asks each character it holds as a modified build (its own marks and, being a relay, the list's)
--     that is online (its hello in his guild, or a word of its that reached his client, refused at
--     the door, in the last ONLINE_FOR: a locked reporter's registrations every 170 s among them) to
--     update, with his standard ask: V3 by whisper from his own character (Workshop.AskUpdate), which
--     every version shows as his update window. Not wrapped in a relay's RM: a reporter delivers an
--     RM's word as a channel word (Relay.lua's Deliver, Comm.Inject("CHANNEL")) and hands it to its
--     guild, and Workshop.HandleUpdate drops a V3 that did not come by whisper from the author, on
--     1.5.1 as here. Once per character a PROMPT_EVERY, PROMPT_MAX a PROMPT_EVERY in all, the longest
--     unasked first, never while his queue has fewer than PROMPT_ROOM places free (the relay's own
--     words first; tried again a minute later), never to a character not marked.
--   * The view: /oly builds, a copyable window (the owner cannot copy chat lines); the right-click
--     menu's version line, "Olympus <release it was made from> (modified build)" (Versions.lua,
--     Builds.Shown: never the rest of the version string).
--   BD~1~<reporter's guild>~<name>~<version>~h|a|c~<first>~<last>~<their guild>   GUILD and CHANNEL
--   (h the hello, a a version answer, c the character announced the release <version> to the sender)
