The private key never leaves ~/.olympus. The addon carries only the public key (Sign.lua) and
checks the signature: RSA-2048, e = 3, PKCS#1 v1.5 over SHA-256. CouncilList.lua holds the lists:
it is copied to the author's own game only (never in the repository or the public zip).

"sign" writes the name list alone (HS1, ns.COUNCIL_SIGNED), as before 0.9.9. "council" reads
the council from a JSON file (~/.olympus/council.json unless a path is given):

  {"realm": "optional realm group", "public": false,
   "departments": [{"name": "Department of War", "icon": "INV_Sword_04",
                    "members": [{"name": "First Surname", "title": "Operations Director"}]}],
   "members": [{"name": "First Surname", "title": "optional"}]}

and writes two lists: the names (HS1, every name of the departments and of "members", which
0.9.8 clients read too) and the departments and titles (HT1, ns.COUNCIL_TITLES, 0.9.9):
  HT1~<time>~<realm group>~<public 0|1>~<departments>~<signature>
  <departments>: <name>^<icon>^<First Surname>=<title>,...;...   ("members": the entry with no name)
"members" are the councillors outside any department; a title and a department's icon (a game
icon's name under Interface\\Icons, or its file number) may be left out. "public": whether
everyone sees the council in the census (until then, the councillors and the author alone).

The King's Steward (1.0.0): an optional "stewards" list in the same file names the characters
who name Hands of their own beside the King's, set up for the King what only he could set up
(the treasury's keepers and what the army sees of it) and send the Crown's decrees on every
client:

  "stewards": ["First Surname-Realm", {"name": "First Surname-Realm", "faction": "Horde"}]

A plain name is the Alliance King's Steward; the Horde gets one only when the list names one
for it. The titles list carries them in an entry of its own after the departments, one per
faction ("^steward^<faction>^<First Surname-Realm>,..."): three "^" where a department has two,
so 0.9.9 clients leave it out unread and still take, show and pass on the whole list. At most 3
per faction; a name of letters with one space at most, its realm (that realm's group) or none
(any realm of the list's group). "steward" adds one to the council file (rewritten whole, the
rest kept) and signs the council at once; "steward --remove" takes him off and signs again: the
newer list ends it on every client. "check" (or --check) reads a written CouncilList.lua back,
checks both signatures with the key and prints the names, departments and Stewards it holds.

The approved guilds (1.1): guilds of Asmon's Olympus whose names the addon's name rule leaves out
(it leaves Olympian and Olympia out on purpose) count as Olympus guilds once an optional
"guilds" list in the same file names them:

  "guilds": ["Guild Name", {"name": "Guild Name", "faction": "Horde"}]

A plain name is an Alliance guild. The titles list carries them after the Stewards, one entry per
faction ("^guilds^<faction>^<Guild Name>,..."), three "^" again, so clients before 1.1 leave it out
unread. At most 20 per faction; a name of letters and spaces, 24 characters at most, as the game
allows; each once. "guild" adds one to the council file and signs the council at once; "guild
--remove" takes it off and signs again. Both print the signed titles list whole, for pasting in
game with /oly approved paste: the first member of such a guild has no other way to get it (its
addon hears nothing of Olympus until it holds it); his addon then passes it to his guild.

The Blood Arena's signed arbiters (1.2): an optional "arbiters" list in the same file names the
characters who may arbitrate public fights and direct rehearsals on test builds, whatever the
King's own list says, one faction's at most MAX_ARBITERS; "audit": true also makes one an auditor
(he receives the arena's ledgers):

  "arbiters": ["First Surname-Realm", {"name": "First Surname-Realm", "faction": "Horde", "audit": true}]

The titles list carries them after the approved guilds, one entry per faction
("^arbiter^<faction>^<First Surname-Realm>[+a],..."), three "^" again, so clients before 1.2 leave
it out unread. A name as a Steward's (a realm of the list's group). "arbiter" adds one (with
--audit: an auditor too) and signs the council at once; "arbiter --remove" takes him off and signs
again. No arena file names the author: this entry is how his own character arbitrates too.

The Missionary Church of Olympus's Twelve Apostles (1.1.6): an optional "apostles" list in the same
file names them, at most MAX_APOSTLES per faction, set once here so they hold on every client with
nobody online (the Head of the Church, the King or the author may change them in game later, until
a newer list):

  "apostles": ["First Surname-Realm", {"name": "First Surname-Realm", "faction": "Horde"}]

The titles list carries them after the arbiters, one entry per faction
("^apostles^<faction>^<First Surname-Realm>,..."), three "^" again, so clients before 1.1.6 leave it
out unread. A name as a Steward's (a realm of the list's group). "apostle" adds one and signs the
council at once; "apostle --remove" takes him off and signs again. Asmongold is the immutable
Head of the Church, using the addon's canonical King identity. It is not an assignable Apostle
position. Remove legacy "head": true flags before signing a new list; old signed starred lists
remain readable by the addon but confer no Head authority.

The launch identities (1.3.4; Queen added in 1.4.6). The addon pins the King, the Queen, the Treasurer and the author by name on the
beta's realm group only (names get sniped on launch realms, so the code names nobody for them). On
any other realm group they are whom the titles list names for it, from optional fields of the same
file:

  "king": {"Alliance": "First Surname-Realm", "Horde": "First Surname-Realm"},
  "queen": {"Alliance": "First Surname-Realm", "Horde": "First Surname-Realm"},
  "speedrunner": {"Alliance": "First Surname-Realm"},
  "quaestor": {"Alliance": ["First Surname-Realm"]},
  "treasurer": {"Alliance": ["Treasurer Name-Realm", "Mail Character-Realm"]},
  "author": ["First Surname-Realm", {"name": "First Surname-Realm", "faction": "Horde"}],
  "realms": [{"name": "Realm", "kind": "pvp", "region": "NA"}]

The titles list carries them after the Apostles, three "^" again, so clients before 1.3.4 leave them
out unread and still take, show and pass on the whole list:
  ^king^<faction>^<Name-Realm>   ^queen^<faction>^<Name-Realm>   ^treasurer^<faction>^<Name-Realm>,...   ^author^<faction>^<Name-Realm>,...
  ^realms^<NA|EU>^<Realm>=<pvp|pve|rp|rppvp|hardcore>,...
  ^speedrunner^<faction>^<Name-Realm>   (1.5.5: the Olympus Speedrunner, the level race's gold comet and its title, no authority)
  ^quaestor^<faction>^<Name-Realm>,...  (1.5.5: the Quaestors, the Treasurer's executors: the Treasurer's blue dragon, their title
                                         and a trusted relay of their side; none of the Treasurer's powers; 2 a faction)
Every name needs its realm (a name without one would count on every realm of the group), a realm of
the list's group. One King and one Queen a faction; the Queen is a presentation identity only and
receives no King, council, officer or moderation authority. The Treasurer first, then his mail characters (where the dues'
mail goes), 4 in all; 8 author's characters a faction (both factions' count: the dev's privileges
alone, never the King's or the council's); 40 realms a region. A side named here has that King or
Treasurer alone; a side named nowhere keeps the code's pin on the beta alone, and on a launch realm
group has none: no guild master of a guild called Olympus stands for the King where this list reaches.

Launch day, once the realms and the characters exist (nothing in the repository names them):
  1. python3 scripts/council-sign.py council --group "<Realm>+<Realm>"
     The launch realm group, kept in the council file. While a Steward, an arbiter, an Apostle or a
     signed leader carries a realm of another group, it is refused with the whole list of them and
     the command that takes each off.
  2. author "<Name-Realm>" (each of your characters), king "<Name-Realm>" [Horde], queen "<Name-Realm>" [Horde],
     treasurer "<Treasurer-Realm>,<Mail-Realm>" [Horde], realm "<Realm>" <kind> <NA|EU> (each realm):
     each signs the whole council again and prints the titles list to paste. Sign the King once his
     character leads the King's guild: a census report of that guild naming another guild master is
     refused while a King is named (as on the beta), and its guild master is the King only if named.
  3. check; copy dist/CouncilList.lua into the game (Interface/AddOns/Olympus/) and /reload: that
     client takes both lists and relays them. Anyone else in Olympus can paste the printed HT1~ text
     with /oly approved paste, and passes it on. /oly status: "identities: King signed ...".

Cross-guild leadership migration (1.2): absent by default, so the documented census behaviour is
unchanged. It is activated only by the deliberately explicit "leadership" object below:

  "leadership": {"mode": "enforce", "epoch": 1, "factions": ["Alliance"],
    "guilds": [{"guild": "Olympus II", "leader": "Lord Name-ClassicBetaPvP",
                "officers": ["Captain One-ClassicBetaPvP2"], "faction": "Alliance"}]}

Every character must carry an exact realm from the signed realm group. Each enforced faction gets
an entry even when its guilds list is empty (the signed empty tombstone). Once a client accepts an
enforcing entry, it remembers that one-way boundary locally: an expired, malformed, lower-epoch or
newer absent entry grants nobody and never reopens census authority. Increase "epoch" for a new
authority generation; ordinary additions/removals may keep it. The manifest lasts 14 days.

Leadership is signed separately from HT1 as one or more HA1 parts in
`ns.COUNCIL_AUTHORITY`. Each part binds the SHA-256 of the complete canonical manifest and is
independently signed. Receivers activate the one-way fail-closed boundary on the first valid part,
but grant roles only after every part of that exact set verifies and the joined digest matches.
Parts split only between guild entries. Older addon versions ignore H2/H3. The set is deliberately
bounded; the signer refuses anything beyond the addon's guild, person, part and byte limits.

Every list gets a newer time than the last one signed with the key (kept in the key file as
"last_at"): clients keep a list only if it is newer than theirs, so two lists signed in the
same second both reach them. Anything the addon would not take is refused here, before anything
is signed: a "~" or "|" or a control character anywhere; a "," in a name; a "^", ";", "=" or
"," in a name, title or department of the titles list; a name or title of more than 48 bytes, a
department of more than 40; more than 30 names, or a name twice; more than 8 departments; an icon
that is not a game icon's name or number; a list longer than the addon takes.
OLYMPUS_COUNCIL_KEY, OLYMPUS_COUNCIL_OUT and OLYMPUS_COUNCIL_JSON give other paths for the key,
the lists and the council (the tests use a throwaway key in a temporary folder).
